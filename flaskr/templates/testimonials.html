The entire family had a great time building a miniature home!
And yes, the kids put down their gadget because of this. I would definitely recommend the WikiHouse Kit.

I'm not a crafty person and I was hesitant to buy the Seed Eco-home Kit but I wanted to see
how a sustainable house would look like. It was a good decision to purchase one. It's so easy to assemble too!

I've always been a fan of toy cars. I actually have a collection of cars since I was small.
But this Tobby Toy Car kit is totally different because I get to experience how to put it together. Thanks OpenHouseParty!
